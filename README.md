# 3D-Game
 
This is my first game ever, made using unity(c#). 

## Goal

My goal was to build a game all on my own, but it quickly changed once I started (I made the levels too hard).
Therefor, my new goal was to:
Finish all the levels I've created. (they are quite hard, but not impossible)

## Controls

A/D for Left/Right
(pretty basic)
